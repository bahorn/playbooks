# Playbooks

Just a collection of ansible playbooks I have.

## `kernel-dev.yml`

Installs dependencies for setting up a kernel dev environment on Ubuntu.

Mainly meant for experimenting with the USB gadget interface (why the kernel
config directly enables it)


## `update.yml`

Updates all packages installed by apt, flatpak and snap.

## `systemConfig`

Directory containing playbooks for setting up systems to match my normal needs.
